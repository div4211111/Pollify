## Pollify

Introducing "Pollify" - the app that lets you create and participate in private polls with your friends! With Pollify, you can easily propose different options on any topic, and then invite your friends to join in and vote for their favorites.

The app allows you to customize each poll by setting the number of options each participant can choose, and also provides a code that you can share with your friends to join the polling session. Once all the participants have cast their votes, Pollify automatically calculates the results and determines the most popular option.

But that's not all - if there are multiple options with the same number of votes, Pollify automatically initiates a second round of voting where only the tied options will participate. This ensures that the final winner is always the most preferred option among all the participants.

Whether you want to make group decisions on what to watch on Netflix, which restaurant to go to, or what activities to do with your friends, Pollify has got you covered!
